- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mdrahmed
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in security, privacy, Cyber-physical systems, LLVM, Software Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working in a reasearch project trying to build a new logging system that will be able to detect APT attacks in industry floors.
- ðŸ“« Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any security, cyber-physical system or, software development project. It would be great if we need to work with the LLVM for the project. Currently, there are only a few repo in here. But I did some really cool things with LLVM present here as private. 
Like, 
 - Adding code in runtime. 
 - Modify code.
 
If you need to talk about that then simply email me, I will get back to you.
